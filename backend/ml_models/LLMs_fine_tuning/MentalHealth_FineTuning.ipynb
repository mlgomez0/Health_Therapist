a tough time with this situation i have worked with a number of young adults in their s who have had to move back home after college or even stay at home through the college years bottom line is that either way it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be to have to live at home i have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home they suddenly feel like a kid again the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet and i want to be respectful of you and our home at the same time though i feel like it is important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with if she is receptive maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both if this is too hard to do alone perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of compromise contract this is not an easy situation but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that does not take place in the heat of the moment your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withgood luck elissa gross\",\n          \"i am so sorry to hear about your recent loss there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and it is never easy i think it is important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time\",\n          \"i have had these many cases but in situations like this if it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved sit down and

a tough time with this situation i have worked with a number of young adults in their s who have had to move back home after college or even stay at home through the college years bottom line is that either way it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be to have to live at home i have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home they suddenly feel like a kid again the old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults i would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like i am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here i really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until i get on my feet and i want to be respectful of you and our home at the same time though i feel like it is important for me to have more independence than when i was younger because i am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with if she is receptive maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both if this is too hard to do alone perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of compromise contract this is not an easy situation but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that does not take place in the heat of the moment your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withgood luck elissa gross\",\n          \"i am so sorry to hear about your recent loss there is such a large feeling of uncertainty that befalls those of us left to sort through these emotions of such a loss and it is never easy i think it is important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else the fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions when it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty the more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours the more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss in talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level writing a poem planting a tree etc or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc we never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us nowbut that also takes time\",\n          \"i have had these many cases but in situations like this if it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved sit down and

will cheat on her she does not know why last time we had sex she cried and felt bad and did not know why she cried however she also told me that the last time we had sex she felt me in her but it just felt ehh and wanted to stop that makes me feel really awful we rarely have foreplay everything i try tickles her so she makes me stop we are both frustrated but very much in love she and i are in our early s we are married and we have a baby on the way Response: i suggest seeking the support of an aasect certified sex therapist to help work through much of the issues you address you simply may need some really qualified support also you might be interested in watching esther perels ted talk on the secret to desire in a long term relationship andor you might want to sign up for my own

looked at his phone as well as sharing with him any fears or concerns that you are having about the long distance relationship trust is the foundation of any successful relationship and when doubt distrust creep into a relationship it can undermine the long term health of the relationship hopefully he will understand your concerns and appreciate your honesty this also might be a good time to

leave her in texas to travel back to louisiana she does not remember that i do over the years i thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship she gave me good reason to doubt that on

drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job months running now i am not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now help Response: was either parent abusive or

have lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetratorif you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do soat the very least you will be actively
